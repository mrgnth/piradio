# PiRadio

A simple Webradio Player Interface for the Raspberry Pi using Vue.js and Flask.

## Getting Started

This project was originally based on Gui Talarico's most excellent [Flask-VueJs-Template](https://github.com/gtalarico/flask-vuejs-template), that really accelerated my first setup with no prior knowledge of Vue.js.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installation (for Development)

* Node
* NPM
* Python 3.6

Here are the basic steps required to get a development setup working:

* First off, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mrgnth/piradio.git

* Set up a Virtual Environment

* Install Python dependencies using pip or pipenv from the project directory:

    `$ pipenv install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Install npm dependencies

    ```
